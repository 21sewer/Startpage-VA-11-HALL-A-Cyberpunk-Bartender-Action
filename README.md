# VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action startpage
This is my first startpage, a random project made after seeing some basic tutorials, it is heavily inspired by [this one](https://gitlab.com/wolfiy/wlfys-minimal-startpage). This startpage is made from scratch, but following wolfiy's design.

## Use
You can use the startpage in FireFox and Chrome as well. It seems that is funcionating on Opera Browser, but it might take more work implementing it.
